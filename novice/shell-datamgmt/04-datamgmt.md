# Data management

## Project organization

When we were working with the shell we put the materials from this workshop together into a folder that looked like this.

~~~
|-- swc-wise-umich/
|-- |-- data/
|-- |-- |-- (data files here)
|-- |-- R/
|-- |-- |-- (R scripts here)
|-- |-- notes/
~~~
{:class="out"}

Now we're going to talk a little about data management, and specifically about organizing projects in ways that will make it easier to collaborate with yourself and others.

*First, take a minute to talk to your neighbor about how you typically organize your work. When you start a new project, where do you store the files? How do you keep track of what's what as things change throughout the project? Does anyone have a system that works really well for them?*

Now, I'm going to show you an example of a project I worked on one summer during my undergrad. I was trying to use historic Coast Guard ice patrol log books to understand changes in sea ice and wildlife in the Arctic. This is my folder of stuff related to that project *(show Logbook project folder)*.

It's been a few years and I have no idea what most of this is. The log books I used are mixed in with my own notes, which are not organized. *Highlight "organized_sightings" versions*. I can't even be sure what my final writeup was; I'm guessing it's "icebergpaper.docx" but that's pretty vague. What are these folders? What's going on?

At the time I worked on this project I knew exactly what everything was, but now I have no clue. A year or so ago my advisor contacted me asking for some information about things I had done, and I didn't remember and couldn't figure it out from this mess of files.

*How many of you could answer specific questions about details of your analyses or projects a year later? Five years?*

*How many of you think if you handed your work over to someone else right now, they'd be able to figure out what's what?*

A little thinking ahead at the beginning of a project can save huge amounts of time and headache later on.
